# Jointly Analysis of HiC, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and DNase-seq Data in Human Breast Tissues and MCF-7 Cells

## Overview
This repository provides the analysis of multi-omic data generated from **HiC** profiling on healthy/malignant breast tissues from human donors and **ATAC-seq**, **ChIP-seq**, **RNA-seq**, and **DNase-seq** profiling on the **MCF-7** breast cancer cell line and healthy breast tissues from human donors. 

These **ATAC-seq**, **ChIP-seq**, **RNA-seq**, and **DNase-seq** profiles are sourced from the **ENCODE** database. 

The **HiC** profiling data are from the study:

This work investigates the chromatin architecture, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility in both cancerous and healthy breast tissues. 

The integrated use of these sequencing techniques allows for a comprehensive understanding of chromatin dynamics, transcriptional regulation, and the potential alterations associated with breast cancer. By combining these techniques, we explore the relationships between chromatin structure and gene expression in normal and tumorigenic breast tissues.
