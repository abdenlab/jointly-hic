Storage and computational costs mount sharply with data resolution when such maps are stored in dense form. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop data storage strategies that handle the full range of useful resolutions in multidimensional genomic datasets by taking advantage of their sparse nature, while supporting efficient compression and providing fast random access to facilitate development of scalable algorithms for data analysis. RESULTS: We developed a file format called cooler, based on a sparse data model, that can support genomically labeled matrices at any resolution. It has the flexibility to accommodate various descriptions of the data axes (genomic coordinates, tracks and bin annotations), resolutions, data density patterns and metadata. Cooler is based on HDF5 and is supported by a Python library and command line suite to create, read, inspect and manipulate cooler data collections. The format has been adopted as a standard by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Cooler is cross-platform, BSD-licensed and can be installed from the Python package index or the bioconda repository. The source code is maintained on Github at https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler.

To date, the most commonly used method for dimensionality reduction in the microbiome is calculation of between-sample microbial differences (beta diversity), followed by principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is an alternative method that can reduce the dimensionality of beta diversity distance matrices. Here, we demonstrate the benefits and limitations of using UMAP for dimensionality reduction on microbiome data. Using real data, we demonstrate that UMAP can improve the representation of clusters, especially when the clusters are composed of multiple subgroups. Additionally, we show that UMAP provides improved correlation of biological variation along a gradient with a reduced number of coordinates of the resulting embedding. Finally, we provide parameter recommendations that emphasize the preservation of global geometry. We therefore conclude that UMAP should be routinely used as a complementary visualization method for microbiome beta diversity studies. IMPORTANCE UMAP provides an additional method to visualize microbiome data. The method is extensible to any beta diversity metric used with PCoA, and our results demonstrate that UMAP can indeed improve visualization quality and correspondence with biological and technical variables of interest.

This method is based on Chromosome Conformation Capture, in which chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, then digested, and re-ligated in such a way that only DNA fragments that are covalently linked together form ligation products. The ligation products contain the information of not only where they originated from in the genomic sequence but also where they reside, physically, in the 3D organization of the genome. In Hi-C, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions followed by deep sequencing. The compatibility of Hi-C with next generation sequencing platforms makes it possible to detect chromatin interactions on an unprecedented scale. This advance gives Hi-C the power to both explore the biophysical properties of chromatin as well as the implications of chromatin structure for the biological functions of the nucleus. A massively parallel survey of chromatin interaction provides the previously missing dimension of spatial context to other genomic studies. This spatial context will provide a new perspective to studies of chromatin and its role in genome regulation in normal conditions and in disease.}, number={3}, journal={Methods (San Diego, Calif.)}, publisher={Elsevier BV}, author={Belton, Jon-Matthew and McCord, Rachel Patton and Gibcus, Johan Harmen and Naumova, Natalia and Zhan, Ye and Dekker, Job}, year={2012}, month=nov, pages={268–276}, language={en} }

TADs have internal substructures that are often cell type specific, but their higher-order organization remains elusive. Here, we investigate TAD higher-order interactions with Hi-C through neuronal differentiation and show that they form a hierarchy of domains-within-domains (metaTADs) extending across genomic scales up to the range of entire chromosomes. We find that TAD interactions are well captured by tree-like, hierarchical structures irrespective of cell type. metaTAD tree structures correlate with genetic, epigenomic and expression features, and structural tree rearrangements during differentiation are linked to transcriptional state changes.

It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects.

Hi-C is a chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based technology to detect pair-wise chromatin interactions genome-wide, and has become a benchmark tool to study genome organization. In Hi-C, chromatin conformation is first captured by chemical cross-linking of cells. Cells are then lysed and subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, before the ends of the resulting fragments are marked with biotin. Fragments within close 3D proximity are ligated, and the biotin label is used to selectively enrich for ligated junctions. Finally, isolated ligation products are prepared for high-throughput sequencing, which enables the mapping of pair-wise chromatin interactions genome-wide. Over the past decade, “next-generation” sequencing has become cheaper and easier to perform, enabling more interactions to be sampled to obtain higher resolution in chromatin interaction maps. Here, we provide an in-depth guide to performing an up-to-date Hi-C procedure on mammalian cell lines. These protocols include recent improvements that increase the resolution potential of the assay, namely by enhancing cross-linking and using a restriction enzyme cocktail.

We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus.

We find that heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, HP1α and HP1β correlates with strong compartmentalization. We demonstrate that disruption of DNA methyltransferase activity greatly remodels genome compartmentalization whereby domains lose H3K9me3-HP1α/β binding and acquire the neutrally interacting state while retaining late replication timing. Furthermore, we show that H3K9me3-HP1α/β heterochromatin is permissive to loop extrusion by cohesin but refractory to CTCF binding.
